# Big-O notation: 
 In regards to BIg-O notation, n is normally your input size, because n can increase and can also result in time and space complewxity increasing, we ideally want to have time and space complexity increase at the smallest rate with n increasing. To get big-0 notation always simplify it to fastest growing worst case scenario.
