DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

# JAVA notes
- double is the data type for decimals. 
- when you expect an answer to be a decimal don't forget to use double to define your variables for at least one of them. 
- For whole numbers, always use int (integer)
- Don't forget there is a difference between '==' and 'equals', where '==' will give you a false value if the two data types being compared are completely different objects , although they may look the same. 
- Scanner is used to take user input, and you need to import it when you're writing the programme. Always close your scanner when you use it (scanner.close()). You want to use .nextLine() all the time for inout an d then change it back t a double or int or whatever you want, since .nextLine takes strigs.
- remember the difference between arrays and arraylists dynamic arrays)   

# Big-O notation: 
 In regards to BIg-O notation, n is normally your input size, because n can increase and can also result in time and space complexity increasing, we ideally want to have time and space complexity increase at the smallest rate with n increasing. To get big-0 notation always simplify it to fastest growing worst case scenario.
